# Hiii,

I'm roxie, but you might also know me as roxcelic or angle, *your friendly neighborhood technomancer*. If you're looking at this, you know who I am, and it's more than likely not for a good reason, if I do say so. But here are some of the things I do:

- Make games
  - Sorta. I get really into it and then just lose energy, but I am going to college for it hopefully.

- Make weird and scary JS scripts
  - I used to have Python as my main mess-about language, but recently that's changed to JS.
  - I actually find that JS is way better than Python to have fun with.
    - It also helps that everything can run JS files, well, any device I can find when bored.

- Make music or art
  - I sometimes make both of those things, but I don't usually post them.
    - I used to, I think?

There's a lot more that I do than that, but those are probably the main reasons anyone would seek out my GitHub account. But if you're here, thanks! I hope you find what you're looking for ^^
