# Hi,

So, since you're here, you like me. Pretty rare...

But hey! I'm Roxie, a 16-year-old developer who makes some amazing and scary creations. I love game development, but it takes so very long, and I have a short attention span, so don't expect much of that from me. I have been considering making a text-based Python game, but I might swap that out for JavaScript now.
My pronouns are `she/they` and I'd probably consider myself to be genderfluid if anyone asks (which no one will).

I'm really passionate about my website and music. I think that music kind of helps the soul in a non-weird and hippy way.
But weird and hippy does seem to be kind of my style. I love art too; I just suck at drawing people that have a higher resolution than 32-16px, so...

But thanks for listening. Wanna go [back](https://github.com/roxcelic)?
